## Summary
* As we can see, the average temperatures for June and December differ by about 3 degrees. This means keeping the ice-cream shop open all year would give relatively the same amount of sales.
* A query to create a table that compares the statistics would help in seeing the differences side by side.
* Adding data for ice-cream sales compared to temperature in Hawaii would also help to predict profits in the summer vs winter.
